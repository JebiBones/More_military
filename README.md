# More_military
A mod for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, it adds more military professions to the game.

This mod adds 6 new classes to CDDA, Rifleman, Combat Medic, Machine Gunner, NCO, Commisioned Officer and H.E.C.U Marine (Inspired by Half-Life).
Except for the H.E.C.U Marine, I tried to keep the mod as vanilla and "balanced" as posible so feedback would be apretiated to tune some things.

Also, I took my time to include some custom sprites for the new items to be used with MSX++DeadPeopleEdition tileset (https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/Cata-MSX-DeadPeopleTileset) so I would thankful if SomeDeadGuy adds those to the main branch :P

Anyways, enjoy!
